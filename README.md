## Design Decisions

### Project Board

To manage the [Project](https://github.com/users/GuyMitchy/projects/1/views/1) and keep track of the required tasks. Agile methodologies were adopted throughout the project by utilising User Stories, a KanBan board and holding stand up / Stand downs.

</p>
<br>

### Mood Board

The team decided to consolidate initial design ideas via a [Mood Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLc0PLq0=/) was created as a method of brainstorming ideas amongst the team, whilst keeping a record of the thought process.

### Wireframes

Within the initial planning stage of the project, wireframes were created to provide initial layouts and to ensure all members of the team were envisioning the same design and starting point for the web application.

### Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility considerations have been considered throughout the projects creation. Such as colour schemes, colour contrasts, fonts and alt text attributes are set correctly.

#### Colour Scheme

A dark background with aqua colour scheme was chosen to keep with the retro 90's computer terminal theme.

<p align="center">

</p>
<br>

#### Colour Contrast Checks

Colour contrast has been consider and the chosen colour scheme has been tested via an online [Colour Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

#### Fonts

Google fonts were used within the project to enable additional customisation to the application as well adding to the general theme and feel of the application.

</p>
<br>

- **Scoring And Completion:** A feature to allow a visual way of keeping score for the player.


- **Randomised Questions:** Randomising the presented quiz questions from the initial bank of 30 quiz question


- **Varied Question Content:** Quiz questions should have varied content, taking into consideration different topics as well as adding images as question answers as well as more visual content.


### Optional Features (Could-Haves)

- **Custom Json Questions:** Additional customisation of the quiz can be done via the user submitting a custom JSON file to allow the user choose their own questions and or revision topic

<p align="center">

- **Timer Toggle:** Addition of a timer to increase the difficulty of the quiz and force the user to think quickly.


- **Puzzle Integration:** The addition of more puzzles, rather than simple answer the question style questions


- **Visual Theme Toggle:** Addition of themes that can be toggled between each other. Proposed colours are aqua by default, orange, green and a light or white. These chosen colours are based off traditional terminal themes.

## Testing and Validation

### Testing Results
Testing the application has been an ongoing process throughout the development of the website. With a focus on responsiveness across all standard screen sizes, various edits were made throughout the development process to ensure the application looks and performs well on mobile, tablet and desktop. The team agreed to deploy early to allow to additional live testing encase there were any inconsistencies between the development environment and the live application.

### Known Bugs

- **Bug:**
Quiz question icons, don't scale properly on higher resolution screens, the question icons are really small on the screen.
- ***Fix:***
Issue resolved, bug was created due to different zoom levels on different developers screen sizes.

- **Bug:**
Random question list generator goes into infinite loop due to use of while.
- ***Fix:***
prevent while loop from starting when number of questions is larger than the list of possible questions.

- **Bug:**
Footer expands past boundary of game board, creating white space and scroll on mobile phones
- ***Fix:***
Pending (Add burger icon for mobile devices?)

- **Bug:**
Text in json files where code has been used as an answer, the answer gets interpreted as code.
- ***Fix:***
html characters in string not displaying properly was: use string.replaceAll to replace < and > characters with correct HTML escape characters - &lt; and &gt; respectively.

- **Bug:**
Close button on display questions modal not working
- ***Fix:***
Corrected indexing to fix this issue

### Validation
Validators were used to help address any issues within the projects HTML, CSS and Javascript files. [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), [JavaScript Linter]()

## Deployment

### Deployment Process
For this project, GitHub pages was the chosen deployment method. A simple and straight forward service provided by github which uses a repo branch as a source for the page to pull from.

## Reflection on Development Process

### Successes
One of the key successes was creating the retro 90's style computer terminal for the Quiz's game board. The entire team contributed to the structure, layout and theme to achieve this.

### Challenges
After deciding on using a JSON format for the storage of quiz questions, Utilising this format as well as linking and looping through the questions in Javascript proved problematic with Javascript's Arrays.

### Final Thoughts
Overall the Quiz Forge project went very well, there were ups and downs as to be expected, Javascript was both kind and hard to tame at the same time. Ensuring the application looks great and responded smoothly and correctly was an ongoing yet enjoyable battle.

The development worked very well together with little to no issues. Stand ups and Downs took place everyday where progress was summarised and a game plan for the next day was formed. Throughout various discussions the entire group was involved in communicating their view, problem, concern or solution.

## Code Attribution
Shuffle function is from this [Stackoverflow Javascript Shuffle](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2450954/how-to-randomize-shuffle-a-javascript-array)

## Future Improvements
With regards to future improvements, generally speaking additional functionality and customisation would be the main areas of focus. For example, extending the quiz's question bank, featuring different topics, additional more challenging questions in the form of puzzles. By utilising JSON as the question storage format, with additional development the user would be given the ability to configure the quiz system to their liking via uploading a custom JSON file to change the content of the quiz.
